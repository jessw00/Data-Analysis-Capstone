# Data Analysis Capstone: An Analysis of Taylor Swift Lyrics 2006-2022

 ![Alt text](image.png)

## About
This project aims to analyize the lyrics from Taylor Swift's first 10 albums, as well as the "vault tracks" on her rerecordings of Fearless and Red. We will be looking at which words are most commonly used in her songs, which songs have the highest amount of unique individual words, and what percentage of songs have clean or explicit lyrics.

## Data Analysis Capstone Requirements (Spring 2023)
Category 1: Loading Data:
    -Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.).

Category 2: Clean and Operate the Data While Combining Them:
    -Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.

Category 3: Visualize/Present Your Data:
    -Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.

Category 4: Best Practices:
    -Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.

Category 5: Interpretation of Your Data:
    -Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don't have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
